Andrej blog post ["The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks"](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) gives you introduction to this models

There is also youtube video, where he explains the implementation details

### Vanilla Char-RNN using TensorFlow by Vinh Khuc (@knvinh).

Adapted from Karpathy's min-char-rnn.py https://gist.github.com/vinhkhuc/7ec5bf797308279dc587

Requires: tensorflow>=1.0
License: BSD

Concise and straightforward tensorflow implementation of Andrej char RNN. You will learn how to create necessary TF variables which stores all input to hidden and hidden to hidden matrices.
